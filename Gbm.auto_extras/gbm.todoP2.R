# log(1-u_i) in calc.deviance: u_i, which is preds, can't be positive, because when inverted (1-u_i)

# Which is u_i in gbm.step. To reiterate:

##73 u_i <- sum(mysamples[,brvcol] * rep(1,119))/119

###All binary results are 1: mysamples[,brvcol]
### So there are no zeroes
### see also original CPUE: mysamples[,4]
### So these are pre-filtered for positives
### you twat###
# Go back & get the original data inc zeroes.
# Done: mothersheet already done, I was using child sheets I never shoulda made.
