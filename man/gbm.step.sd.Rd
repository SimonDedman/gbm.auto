\description{
SD fork of dismo's gbm.step to add evaluation metrics like d.squared and rmse. J. Leathwick and
J. Elith - 19th September 2005, version 2.9. Function to assess optimal no of boosting trees
using k-fold cross validation. Implements the cross-validation procedure described on page 215 of
Hastie T, Tibshirani R, Friedman JH (2001) The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining,
Inference, and Prediction Springer-Verlag, New York.

\details{
Divides the data into 10 subsets, with stratification by prevalence if required for pa data then
fits a gbm model of increasing complexity along the sequence from n.trees to n.trees + (n.steps *
step.size) calculating the residual deviance at each step along the way after each fold
processed, calculates the average holdout residual deviance and its standard error then
identifies the optimal number of trees as that at which the holdout deviance is minimised and
fits a model with this number of trees, returning it as a gbm model along with additional
information from the cv selection process.

D squared is 1 - (cv.dev / total.deviance). Abeare thesis: For each of the
fitted models, the pseudo-R2, or D2, or Explained Deviance, was calculated
for comparison, where: D2 = 1 â€“ (residual deviance/total deviance).

requires gbm library from Cran
requires roc and calibration scripts of J Elith
requires calc.deviance script of J Elith/J Leathwick
