\title{Creates Basemaps for Gbm.auto mapping from your data range}
\usage{
gbm.basemap(bounds, getzip = TRUE, zipvers = "2.3.6",
  savename = "Crop_Map", res = "CALC", extrabounds = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{bounds}{Region to crop to: c(xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax)}

\item{getzip}{Download & unpack GSHHS data to WD? "TRUE" else
absolute/relative reference to GSHHS_shp folder, inc that folder}

\item{zipvers}{GSHHS version, in case it updates. Please email developer (SD)
if this is incorrect}

\item{savename}{Shapefile savename, no extension, default is "Crop_Map"}

\item{res}{Resolution, 1:5 (low:high) OR c,l,i,h,f (coarse, low,
intermediate, high, full) or "CALC" to calculate based on bounds}

\item{extrabounds}{Grow bounds 16pct each direction to expand rectangular
datasets basemaps over the entire square area created by basemap in mapplots}
}
\value{
basemap coastline file for gbm.map in gbm.auto. "cropshp"
SpatialPolygonsDataFramein in local environment & user-named files in
"CroppedMap" folder. Load later with maptools function:
MyMap <- readShapePoly("./CroppedMap/Crop_Map")
}
\description{
Downloads unzips crops & saves NOAAs global coastline shapefiles to user-set
box. Use for 'shape' in gbm.map. If downloading in RStudio uncheck
"Use secure download method for HTTP" in Tools > Global Options > Packages.

\details{
errors and their origins:

1. Error in setwd(getzip) : cannot change working directory
If youve specified the location of the local GSHHS_shp folder, ensure youre
in the correct directory relative to it. This error means it looked for the
folder and couldnt find it.

2. Error in writeSpatialShape(cropshp, savename) x is aNULLobject, not a
compatible Spatial*DataFrame.
Ensure that your lats and longs are the the right way around
}
\examples{
mybounds <- c(range(samples[,3]),range(samples[,2]))
gbm.basemap(bounds = mybounds, getzip = "./GSHHS_shp/", savename =
"My_Crop_Map", res = "f")
In this example GSHHS folder already downloaded to the working directory
hence I pointed getzip at that rather than having it download the zip again.
